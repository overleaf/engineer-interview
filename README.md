# Make a spell checker for BASIC English

## Background

British American Scientific International Commercial (BASIC) English is a constructed language. It has 850 English words, carefully chosen to make the language easy to learn but still powerful enough to communicate every day ideas and actions. The rules of usage are identical to full English, so the speaker communicates in perfectly good, but simple, English.

It is an interesting exercise to try to write out a complicated idea in simple English (e.g. (https://xkcd.com/1133)), and a spell checker that tells you when you are using BASIC English would be a useful tool.

## Objectives

The main objective is to make a spell checker in the time available.

The full list of words is available at (http://ogden.basic-english.org/words.html) but we have included them in this repo as `wordlist.txt`.

## Process

You may choose any language and tools you like to make the spell-checker. You are welcome to use Google and ask us questions.

You can make this as a command line application, an API, something in-browser or anything else.

We would like you to talk us through your decision-making processes as you work.

You will have 50 minutes to accomplish the task, and there will be time at the end for us to ask you questions about your implementation, and how you might improve it.
